The solution is to use strict comparison (`===`) instead of loose comparison (`==`). Strict comparison checks both value and type. 

```php
<?php
$user_input = $_GET['input'];
if ($user_input === 0) {
    echo "Input is zero (integer)";
} elseif ($user_input === "0") {
    echo "Input is zero (string)";
} else {
    echo "Input is not zero";
}
?>
```
This revised code correctly distinguishes between the integer 0 and the string "0", providing more accurate and predictable behavior.
