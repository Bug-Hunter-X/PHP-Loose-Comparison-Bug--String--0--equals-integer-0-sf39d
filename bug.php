This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and loose comparison. The `if` condition `if ($user_input == 0)` will evaluate to true not only when `$user_input` is the integer 0, but also when it's the string "0". This can lead to unexpected behavior if you expect to handle only numerical inputs.

```php
<?php
$user_input = $_GET['input'];
if ($user_input == 0) {
    echo "Input is zero";
} else {
    echo "Input is not zero";
}
?>
```
